<!--
If you want to include any custom html at the beginning of </head> before scripts or links are declared,
put it in /layouts/partials/prepended_head.html. Do not put anything in this file - it's only here so that hugo won't throw an error if /layouts/partials/prepended_head.html doesn't exist.
