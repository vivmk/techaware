#### What is it actually?

GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

#### Why so much fuss about it?

- Reason 1: **Immensely Powerful Community**
- Reason 2: **The Largest Shared Repository**
- Reason 3: **Easy Version Control**
- Reason 4: **A Myriad Of Integrations**
- Reason 5: **Secure Cloud Storage**

Hope those are enough reasons to get you started! :smile:

`Okay, get me started already!`

I will be focusing more on making this work on **Windows OS**. If you are on MacOS / Linux, things might be little different but not a lot. Anyways, things that you will need to start:

1. GitHub account - Create [here](https://github.com/).
2. Git Bash - Download [here](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.28.0.windows.1/Git-2.28.0-64-bit.exe).

Let us have a look at the GitHub workflow now:

Do not worry if it looks scary to you now, at the end of this, you will master it.

### How and where do I start?

Follow these steps in given order:

1. [Create](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise/2.13/user/articles/creating-a-new-repository) a GitHub repository. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with _README_, license, or `gitignore` files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.

2. Open `Git Bash` and change the current working directory to your local project.

3. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository by running:

   ```bash
   $ git init
   ```

4. Add the files in your new local repository. Add the files in the local repository and stages them for commit using the command:

   ```bash
   $ git add .
   ```

5. Commit the files that you have staged in your local repository using:

   ```bash
   $ git commit -m "First commit"
   ```

6. At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click the copy icon of the remote repository URL as shown below:

   ![Copy the repository URL](https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/copy-remote-repository-url-quick-setup.png)

7. In the Command prompt, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed:

   ```bash
   $ git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/your_reponame.git
   $ git remote -v
   ```

8. Push the changes in your local repository to GitHub:

   ```bash
   $ git push origin master
   ```

#### Hey! You just did your first work on your project!

Keep pushing your changes to the repository.

`Note:`
If you are working on [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor, you can connect it directly to your repository using the menu option in the left side bar as described in the tutorial [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github).

### Okay, done. What next?

Next is contributing to a project owned by someone else:

1. Go to the repository on GitHub.
2. Click the “Fork” button at the top right.
3. You will now have your own copy of that repository in your github account.
4. Open a Git Bash and type:

   ```bash
   $ git clone git@github.com:your_username/the_repo
   ```

5. You will now have a local copy of your version of that repository.
6. Change into that project directory (the_repo):

   ```bash
   $ cd the_repo
   ```

7. Add a connection to the original owner’s repository:

   ```bash
   $ git remote add owner_username git://github.com/owner_username/the_repo
   $ git remote -v
   ```

8. Run `git add` and `git commit` those changes.

9. Run `git push` to send them to GitHub. These will go to your version of the repository.

10. When you feel like submitting your changes to the main project of owner, click on `Compare & Pull Request` and send a request as shown:

    ![Pull Request](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/content/images/2020/01/pullRequest-1.png)

### It was bit complicated right?

It is hard. It is always hard the first time you do something. Especially when you are collaborating, making mistakes is not a comfortable thing. But remember, it will be fun once you get used to it :wink:

`Eat, Sleep, Commit, Repeat !`
